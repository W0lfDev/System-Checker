# How to use?

Get it from here: https://github.com/W0lfDev/System-Checker/releases/tag/release

When you launch SystemChecker.exe you will be greeted by an editor.

After you configure your editor settings you have to lock the checker and add it and the .txt file that it comes with (checkerconf.txt) to your app’s folder (The same where the executable of your app is).

# How to Configure?

1.  When you open the editor you will see a help page. You probably typed “Yes” and that's why you are here.
2.  After that, you will see a page that will ask you if you want to change the default GUI style. This isn’t very important, so if you want to you can say “Yes” and experiment with the options.
3.  On the next page, you will see an input field saying “Executable name:”. **It is very important that you put the name of the executable of your app with an extension .exe at the end!**
4.  For example “Executable name: editor.exe” - editor.exe is the executable and the name of the app that I want to launch after the check is passed.
5.  Then you will see a 64bit or 32bit input field. If your app supports 32bit, then type “2”, if although your app supports only 64bit operating system, then you have to type “1”
6.  After this, you have to type how much is the minimum amount of ram that the application supports. **It must be in MB (1GB = 1024MB)!**
7.  Then you have to say how many cores the application needs. It is usually 1, but some applications require more.
8.  And last but not least you have to type how much storage your app need to work. **Again it must be in MB!**
9.  Then just review your information and decide if you want to lock the editor.

I hope this helped :D
